<p class="summary"><span class="red">interaction hacking.</span> How can technology be used to augment, subvert, alter, mediate, and ultimately deepen interaction in a lasting way? Who owns the data created between two people, what if it is captured and used? What if algorithms could understand our relationships and make better interpersonal decisions than we can ourselves? In this workshop, we explore these questions, going beyond knee-jerk reactions, instead choosing to grapple with the gray areas as we live the algorithms first-hand.</p>

<p class='description'>The workshop typically lasts for 3 hours with 6-15 participants. Participants are given a set of prepartory readings and experimental interaction platforms and tools created by the artists. During the workshop, we prototype various uses for these platforms and tools, attempting to break expectations and patterns of social interaction. The experiments are supplemented by discussion of readings and presentation of other interaction research.<br><br>

Themes covered will include glitch, automation and APIs, computer vision, linguistic analysis, security, surveillance, privacy. We will draw on research from sociology, social psychology, computer science, performance studies, and pop culture.<br><br>
