  <p class="summary">"From Memory To Action" allows visitors to translate the information they obtain into immediate physical action, becoming a part of a larger worldwide effort.</p>
  <div id="description">
  <p class="description">The "From Memory to Action" exhibit at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC focuses on ongoing threats of genocide in the world today. Visitors write their responses to the question 'what will you do to help meet the challenge of genocide today?' on cards. The pledges are digitally captured, then projected and animated on a wall, where they join all the other pledges submitted (online and physical) to contribute a small individual action to a larger collective force.
  <br /><br />This project was a collaboration between Small Design Firm, C+G Partners, Potion Design, Upstatement, and CornerStone Exhibits.</p>
