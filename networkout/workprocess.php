<p class="description">My iterative and experimental work process was necessary to achieve a body of work that was coherent and engaging. Trying many different ideas quickly and keeping myself open to failure as well as success, allowed for progress to be made. By testing my projects in a variety of contexts and with different audiences, I came to understand the interactions that took place and the effectiveness of different strategies. I began with initial ideas around specific themes that evolved with each project, developing over the course of the semester into a much deeper understanding of each.<br /><br/>
With each iteration or experiment, it was important to test not only the conceptual aspects, but also the technical ones. Often the functioning of technology was less predictable than the reactions of viewers. However, it was necessary that the technical aspects of the projects were executed seamlessly, so that the focus of viewers would not be distracted from the intended subject.<br /><br/>
I found it very productive to work with a variety of media – video, installation, web, and performance, and from different angles – in the gym, online, and outside of both. This required me to constantly reevaluate the relevance and effectiveness of my work, and kept me from getting stuck on one particular idea or solution. Instead, I was able to work on several different projects simultaneously, with each building on and informing the others.</p>
