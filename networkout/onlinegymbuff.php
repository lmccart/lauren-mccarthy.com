<p class="summary"><span class="description">Online Gym Buff functions as a critique of the situation in which one’s body image is completely separated from the physical body and dependent only on online social networking.</span></p>
<div id="description">
<p class="description">Online Gym Buff involved the creation of an application called Gym Buff that could be added by any Facebook user. The application consisted of a single button labeled "click for an insta-workout". When users clicked, the application automatically filled their status, profile, and newsfeed with phrases such as "_____ is at the gym", "_____ has just benched her body weight", "_____ is getting jacked". These updates would be propogated via the facebook newsfeed to all of the users friends.</p>

  Online social networking culture provides a means to create a representation of self. Online Gym Buff questions the authenticity of these self representations, exploring a situation where the representation is a complete fabrication. How necessary is it for virtual representations to correspond to physical representations? If they differ, is one representation more “real” or accurate than the other?</p></li>
