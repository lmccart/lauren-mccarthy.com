<p class="description">I attached a video camera to different parts of the weight machines, generally the stack of weights or another part of the machine that moved. The camera was aimed at my own body. I then performed my normal lifting routine with the camera running.<br/><br/>The videos were displayed on the large television monitors in the Zesiger Athletic Center, and on small monitors as part of the MIT Zones of Emergency show in May 2008.</p>
