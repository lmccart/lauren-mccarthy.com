<p class="summary"><span class="red">Tools for Improved Social Interacting.</span> Series of wearable devices that use sensors to condition the behavior of the wearer to better adapt to expected social behaviors. Exploring the potential for technology to shape how we think, feel, and act, and questioning our social expectations, attempting to better understand the function and worth of them. Are there alternatives ways of interacting that leave more space for individual expression, thought, and connection?</p>

<p class="description">
The <a class="red" href="../happinesshat/">Happiness Hat</a> trains the wearer to smile more. An enclosed bend sensor attaches to the cheek and measures smile size, a servo motor moves a metal spike into the head inversely proportional to the degree of smile. The smile size data is logged on a microSD memory card for download at the end of each use period.
<br/><br/>
A smile is a simple action that has the power to make you and everyone around you feel better. Just using the muscles to smile can make you feel happier. Seeing someone else smiling triggers mirror neurons in your own brain, causing you to unconsciously smile yourself. What is the potential of feedback to improve the way we act and feel? On the other hand, how often does the appearance we project misrepresent what we are really thinking and feeling? How do we reconcile these ideas?

<p class="description">The Anti-Daydreaming Scarf contains a heat radiation sensor that detects if the wearer is engaged in conversation with another person. While he is, the scarf vibrates periodically to remind the wearer to pay attention and stop daydreaming.</p>

The Body Contact Training Suit requires the wearer to maintain frequent body contact with another person in order to hear normally. If the wearer stops touching someone for too long, static noise begins to play through headphones sewn into hood. A capacitance sensing circuit measures skin to skin body contact via a metal bracelet sewn into the sleeve.
