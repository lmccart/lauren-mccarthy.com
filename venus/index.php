  <p class="summary">Scale, materiality, and form were crucial considerations in this human-scale sculpture intended to activate an empty space.</p>
  <div id="description">
  <p class="description">This project was very much a study in materiality and form.  The assignment required the creation of a human-scale object that had both a skeleton and a skin.  The site of installation was an empty room.<br/><br/>
  The Venus fly trap served as inspiration for my design.  The piece has a metal skeleton and fabric skin, and comes apart into three leaves.  Learning the skills of welding  and sewing was essential to the design and production of form and structure.</p>
