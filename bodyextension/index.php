<p class="title">DRESS SHOES FOR SPONTANEOUS DEPARTURE <span class="date">2005</span></p>
<p class="summary">The transformable heels simultaneously gave me the freedom of spontaneous movement and the ability to conform to formal dress standards.</p>
<div id="description">
<p class="description">Running is an essential part of my life. I wear running shoes as often as possible because I like the freedom of knowing that I can start running at any moment. I am uncomfortable in situations where I cannot do this. <br/><br/>
This pair of transformable running shoes allows the wearer to exist simultaneously in formal and non-formal social situations. The heels can be folded down to function as heeled dress shoes, or folded up to lay flat and function as running shoes. The transmutable qualities of the shoes provide the wearer the freedom of spontaneous movement while maintaining the ability to conform to formal dress standards.</p>
