  <p class="description">My goal with this piece was to make physical activity more psychologically accessible to those rushing between classes and work.  <br/>
    <br/>
    I positioned 15 performers, each participating in a different sport or activity, throughout the long hallway of MIT.  I wanted to stress the simplicity and spontaneity of their actions.  It is not years of practice and superior abilities, but the simple decision to explore the freedom of movement that the human body posseses, that makes one an athlete.</p>
